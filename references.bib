  abstract = {Per-pixel classification algorithms are poorly equipped to monitor urban land use i n images acquired by the current generation of high spatial resolution satellite sensors. This is because urban areas commonly comprise a complex spatial assemblage of spectrally distinct land-cover types. In this study, a technique is described that attempts to derive information on urban land use in two stages. The first involves classification of the image into broad land-cover types. In the second stage, referred to as spatial reclassification, the classified pixels are grouped into discrete land-use categories on the basis of both the frequency and the spatial arrangement of the land-cover labels within a square kernel. The application of this technique, known as SPARK ( \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} Rt eicalaslsification erne el), is demonstrated using a SPOT-1 HRV m ultispectral image of southeast London, England. Preliminary results indicate that SPARK can be used to distinguish quite subtle differences of land use in urban areas.},

  abstract = {Several methods for the analysis of remotely sensed reflectance data are compared, including empirical methods and scattering theories, both of which are important for solving remote sensing problems. The concept of the photon mean optical path length and the implications for use in modeling reflectance spectra are presented. It is shown that the mean optical path length in a particulate surface is in rough inverse proportion to the square root of the absorption coefficient. Thus, the stronger absorber a material is, the less photons will penetrate into the surface. The concept of apparent absorbance (-In reflectance) is presented, and it is shown that absorption bands, which are Gaussian in shape when plotted as absorption coefficient (true absorbance) versus photon energy, are also Gaussians in apparent absorbance. However, the Gaussians in apparent absorbance have a smaller intensity and a width which is a factor of {$\surd$}2 larger. An apparent continuum in a reflectance spectrum is modeled as a mathematical function used to isolate a particular absorption feature for analysis. It is shown that a continuum should be removed by dividing it into the reflectance spectrum or subtracting it from the apparent absorbance and that the fitting of Gaussians to absorption features should be done using apparent absorbance versus photon energy. Kubelka-Munk theory is only valid for materials with small total absorption and for bihemispherical reflectance, which are rarely encountered in geologic remote sensing. It is shown that the recently advocated bidirectional reflectance theories have the potential for use in deriving mineral abundance from a reflectance spectrum.},

The emergence of a European-wide urban policy, has given new impetus to the need for comparable indicators of the quality of life to monitor development and policy implementation. This paper reviews the literature on quality of life indicators, and argues that traditional measures of the quality of life need to be supplemented with two new dimensions that reflect more recent postmodernist thinking about the composition of urban landscapes, and the contribution to the quality of life of the emerging information society. We argue that the challenges of building appropriate indicators reflecting these new dimensions are considerable, even in urban environments so rich in information systems and data sources, if they are to qualify as ?digital cities?. There are difficulties in finding common workable definitions of the indicators themselves, as well as definitions of the relevant populations, including city residents, and users. By raising these issues and suggesting possible avenues for addressing these challenges we contribute to a much-needed debate on how to define such indicators, which is the prerequisite for their development and use.},

The aerosol information is extracted back to the visible based on aerosol models during the retrieval of water-leaving radiances. Quite reasonable water-leaving radiances have been obtained when our algorithm was applied to process hyperspectral imaging data acquired with an airborne imaging spectrometer.},

  abstract = {There is a fundamental spatial mismatch in the data available for modeling human population from satellite imagery. Spectral reflectances are available for each pixel of an image, but ground reference population data are available only for larger zones. The general response has been to build models for the average population density of the zones, utilizing spatially aggregated spectral data. This approach has limitations, both for the modelingprocess andfor the utilization of the resulting spatially aggregated population estimates. A pixel-based alternative is described. Pixels of a Landsat TM image were classified as residential or non-residential using standard techniques. Initial reference populations were assigned by uniformly distributing the population of each zone across its residential pixels. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was used to iteratively regress pixel population on spectral indicators and re-estimate pixel populations. Predictive validity was tested by applying the fitted regression equation to a second image. The pixel-based model produced population estimates of comparable accuracy to those resulting from a much more complex zone-based modeling procedure. The pixel-based procedure was also more robust and more amenable to refinement, particularly at the extremes of population density The relative error in the estimated total urban population of both primary and secondary study areas was less than 2 percent. Median relative error in the population of individual zones was 26 percent in the primary study area (24 percent for urban zones) and 21 percent in the secondary study area (17 percent for urban zones).},

  abstract = {Estimating urban green volume is getting more and more important within the frame of an ecologically orientated city planning and environmentally sustainable development. The first and the last pulse of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data provide the basis for the estimation of green volume, but these optimal data are not always available, particularly for urban areas. That is why this paper deals with the question whether LiDAR data (last pulse only) that have not been taken during the vegetation period allow a sufficient estimation of the green volume. This paper sets up on previous results where LiDAR data have been compared to photogrammetrically determined vegetation height measurements. The subtraction of the laser-based Digital Terrain Model and Digital Surface Model in vegetated areas leads to a vast underestimation of green volume of up to 85\%, which is mainly due to the standing deciduous trees with an underestimation of 90\%. Starting from the existence of different laser response characteristics of various vegetation types, the relative point density and the normalized height of classified nonground points were analyzed in depth. The results show a good separation of different vegetation types. Furthermore, a pragmatic approach of reconstruction of the underestimated vegetation (mainly deciduous trees) is carried out by generating cylinders for the classified nonground points to compensate the volume loss. The point density of nonground points and the normalized height of the laser responses were used to regulate the adaptive cylinder construction based on fuzzy logic techniques. Using reference data, the accuracy could be estimated. In spite of the suboptimal LiDAR data, this paper leads to a sufficiently exact and efficient estimation of green volume compared to the costly conventional methods like field investigations. The method makes a contribution in the field of data improvement and is applicable to similar LiDAR data of other areas.},

Such systems along with spatial analysis techniques like digital image processing and geographical information system (GIS) can be used for the monitoring and planning purposes as these enable the reporting of overall sprawl at a detailed level. In the present work, urban sprawl of the Ajmer city (situated in Rajasthan State of India) has been studied at a mid scale level, over a period of 25 years (1977\textendash 2002), to extract the information related to sprawl, area of impervious surfaces and their spatial and temporal variability. Statistical classification approaches have been used for the classification of the remotely sensed images obtained from various sensors viz. Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ and IRS LISS-III. Urban sprawl and its spatial and temporal characteristics have been derived from the classified satellite images. The Shannon's entropy and landscape metrics (patchiness and map density) have been computed in terms of spatial phenomenon, in order to quantify the urban form (impervious area). Further, multivariate statistical techniques have been used to establish the relationship between the urban sprawl and its causative factors. Results reveal that land development (160.8\%) in Ajmer is more than three times the population growth (50.1\%). Shannon's entropy and landscape metrics has revealed the spatial distribution of the urban sprawl over a period of last 25 years.},

We provide a critical and comprehensive review of the characteristics of remote sensing systems, and in particular the trade-offs between various system parameters, as well as their use in two key research areas: (a) issues resulting from the expansion of urban environments, and (b) sustainable urban development. The analysis identifies three key trends in the existing literature: (a) the integration of heterogeneous remote sensing data, primarily for investigating or modelling urban environments as a complex system, (b) the development of new algorithms for effective extraction of urban features, and (c) the improvement in the accuracy of traditional spectral-based classification algorithms for addressing the spectral heterogeneity within urban areas. Growing interests in renewable energy have also resulted in the increased use of remote sensing\textemdash for planning, operation, and maintenance of energy infrastructures, in particular the ones with spatial variability, such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy.

The rapid, unplanned transformation of urban LULC significantly affects the functions of the associated ecosystem and biodiversity. This study aims to identify the variation in LULC, and its influences on the urban thermal environment, such as LST, urban heat island (UHI), and urban field variance index (UTFVI), for Chattogram city, Bangladesh. Multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper/OLI: Operational Land Imager (TM/OLI) satellite images were used for the years 1999, 2009, and 2019, to classify LULC classes, identify the transition between different LULCs and to quantify variation in LST, UHI and UFVI distribution in the study area. Using the support vector machine algorithm, the LULC was classified, and the accuracy of the categorized maps was more than 85\%. The spectral radiance model was used to extract urban thermal information from satellite images. The analysis of LULC estimation suggests a significant net increase in urban built-up areas (+3.51\%) and a reduction in vegetation cover (-6.81\%). The mean LST distribution shows that the high-temperature zones were associated with built-up areas, with the lowest temperatures being associated with vegetated cover and water bodies. The UHI and UTFVI estimation also indicate a trend toward increased surface heat stress in the study area. The study demonstrates that a rise in the non-evaporative surfaces (built-up area) and a reduction in the green cover has significantly increased the LST, UHI and UTFVI effects in the study area. Remote-sensing techniques were found to be very useful, particularly in minimizing the time required to evaluate urban expansion and to assess the influence of urbanization on LST.},

Socio-economic variables, including population density, income, poverty, employment rate, education level and house characteristics from US census 2000, were integrated with the environmental variables at the block group level to derive indicators of quality of life. Pearson's correlation was computed to analyse the relationships among the variables. Further, factor analysis was conducted to extract unique information from the combined dataset. Three factors were identified and interpreted as material welfare, environmental conditions and crowdedness respectively. Each factor was viewed as a unique aspect of the quality of life. A synthetic index of the urban quality of life was created and mapped based on weighted factor scores of the three factors. Finally, regression models were built to estimate the quality of life in the city of Indianapolis based on selected environmental and socioeconomic variables.},

It is concluded that high resolution satellite image data are a useful complement to census data by giving the environmental perspective in urban analysis.},

  abstract = {The quality of life (QOL) of the Athens-Clarke County of Georgia was assessed by integrating environmental variables extracted from Landsat thematic mapper data with socioeconomic variables obtained from the U.S. Census data. The environmental variables extracted are (1) land use/cover, particularly percentage of urban use; (2) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); and (3) apparent surface temperatures. The socioeconomic variables from the census data are (1) population density, (2) per capita income, (3) median home value, and (4) percentage of college graduates. NDVI, which shows strong negative correlation with ``per cent of urban use'' and ``surface temperatures,'' is in turn strongly correlated with per capita income, population density, and median home value. The environmental and socioeconomic variables are integrated by means of two approaches: (1) principal components analysis and (2) geographical-information-system overlay of ranked data layers. These two approaches constitute respectively an objective and a subjective assessment of the QOL of the study area. The results of these analyses indicate that satellite inwge data can contplentent census data in providing QOL assessment with an environmental perspective.},

The land classes were identified by Landsat 5-TM scenes taken in the same season in 1988 and 1994. The phenomena of land class changes were evaluated by adopting two remote sensing approaches, namely mapping and modelling, in a case study of the Bangkok Metropolitan area of Thailand. The quantitative results of changes, which were computed from a post-classification method, were used to analyse the pattern of changes in the urban land classes. The change-detection analysis indicated that 2\% of agricultural land was lost, and there was a 14\% increase in the commercial areas. The results demonstrated that the pattern of change in the urban land classes in Bangkok was that of agriculture lands to open lands; open lands to residential, and residential to commercial. The highest commercial land growth was observed in the high-density residential areas along main roads and the railway line. Data were generated from the two dates of TM images for the vegetationimpervious-soil (V-I-S) composition model. The trends of changes in the urban land classes and the anatomy of the study area were presented quantitatively through the V-I-S model. Good agreement was obtained between the values of changes computed for the impervious surfaces from the V-I-S model (which showed 6\% changes) and the change-detection map (which showed 5.6\% changes). The results of changes in the spatial pattern of commercial and residential areas (high, medium and low) emphasize that remote sensing data can be used for V-I-S modelling and mapping of urban surface features.},

  abstract = {The rapidly expanding urban areas of the world constitute an environmental challenge for the 21st century that requires both new analytic approaches and new sources of data and information. Management of the urban environment must consider phenomena at three scales, including the physical environment within cities, environmental systems consisting of cities and their regional hinterlands, and the environmental implications of the global network of megacities. Increasing availability of remotely sensed observations and a variety of other geospatial information could facilitate the development of new tools and approaches for understanding the urban environment. These new applications should take advantage of the special characteristics of remotely sensed data, including their broad spatial coverage, their capacity for routine and unobtrusive updating and their ability to provide self-consistent measurements of critical physical properties that would be difficult or expensive to obtain in situ. In many cases, using remote sensing data to measure and monitor urban environmental conditions will be more straightforward than using them for urban planning purposes, where traditional sources of governmental and private sector data are more easily obtained and understood. In developing countries, however, remote sensing may provide fundamental observations of urban growth and environmental conditions that are not available from other sources.},

Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information. RS data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods. Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme has been applications-driven and national development has been its prime motivation. From Bhaskara to Cartosat, India's EO capability has increased manifold. Improvements are not only in spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions, but also in their coverage and value-added products. Some of the major operational application themes, in which India has extensively used remote sensing data are agriculture, forestry, water resources, land use, urban sprawl, geology, environment, coastal zone, marine resources, snow and glacier, disaster monitoring and mitigation, infrastructure development, etc. The paper reviews RS techniques and applications carried out using both optical and microwave sensors. It also analyses the gap areas and discusses the future perspectives.},

The representation of both the ground surface and the features on that surface necessitates the removal of these surface features if a ground surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product is to be produced. This paper examines methods for extracting surface features from a Digital Surface Model (DSM) produced by LiDAR. It is argued that for some applications the extracted surface feature layer can be of almost equal importance to the DEM. The example of flood inundation modelling is used to illustrate how a DEM and a surface roughness layer could be extracted from the original DSM. The potential for refining surface roughness estimates by classifying extracted surface features using both topographic and spectral characteristics is considered using an Artificial Neural Network to discriminate between buildings and trees.},

  abstract = {Inundation disasters, caused by sudden water level rise or rapid flow, occur frequently in various parts of the world. Such catastrophes strike not only in thinly populated flood plains or farmland but also in highly populated villages or urban areas. Inundation of the populated areas causes severe damage to the economy, injury, and loss of life; therefore, a proper management scheme for the disaster has to be developed. To predict and manage such adversity, an understanding of the dynamic processes of inundation flow is necessary because risk estimation is performed based on inundation flow information. In this study, we developed a comprehensive method to conduct detailed inundation flow simulations for a populated area with quite complex topographical features using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Detailed geospatial information including the location and shape of each building was extracted from the LiDAR data and used for the grid generation. The developed approach can distinguish buildings from vegetation and treat them differently in the flow model. With this method, a fine unstructured grid can be generated representing the complicated urban land features precisely without exhausting labour for data preparation. The accuracy of the generated grid with different grid spacing and grid type is discussed and the optimal range of grid spacing for direct representation of urban topography is investigated. The developed method is applied to the estimation of inundation flows, which occurred in the basin of the Shin-minato River. A detailed inundation flow structure is represented by the flow model, and the flow characteristics with respect to topographic features are discussed.

With the development of remote sensing technology such as the high spatial resolution sensors, 3D laser scanning, data mining and advanced image processing technology, remote sensing can be widely used in the whole range of urban planning processes. In this paper, we firstly make a review of the urban remote sensing applications in urban study and planning by giving examples.

This paper reviews the small-footprint LiDAR sensor \textemdash{} one of the latest high resolution airborne remote sensing technologies, and its application on urban land cover classification. While most of the early researches focus on the analysis of geometric components of 3D LiDAR data point clouds, there has been an increasing interest in investigating the use of intensity data, waveform data and multi-sensor data to facilitate land cover classification and object recognition in urban environment. In this paper, the advancement of airborne LiDAR technology, including data configuration, feature spaces, classification techniques, and radiometric calibration/correction is reviewed and discussed. The review mainly focuses on the LiDAR studies conducted during the last decade with an emphasis on identification of the approach, analysis of pros and cons, investigating the overall accuracy of the technology, and how the classification results can serve as an input for different urban environmental analyses. Finally, several promising directions for future LiDAR research are highlighted, in hope that it will pave the way for the applications of urban environmental modeling and assessment at a finer scale and a greater extent.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a complete modeling system that extracts complex building structures with irregular shapes and surfaces. Our modeling approach is based on the use of airborne LiDAR which offers a fast and effective way to acquire models for a large urban environment. To verify and refine the reconstructed ragged model, we present a primitive-based model refinement approach that requires minor user assistance. Given the limited user input, the system automatically segments the building boundary, does the model refinement, and assembles the complete building model. By adapting a set of appropriate geometric primitives and fitting strategies, the system can model a range of complex buildings with irregular shapes. We demonstrate this system's ability to model a variety of complex buildings rapidly and accurately from LiDAR data of the entire USC campus.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of incorporating remote sensing information in modeling house values in the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. In particular, a Landsat ETM+ image was utilized to derive environmental characteristics, including the fractions of vegetation, impervious surface, and soil, with a linear spectral mixture analysis approach. These environmental characteristics, together with house structural attributes, were integrated to house value models. Two modeling techniques, a global OLSregression and a regression tree approach, were employed to build the relationship between house values and house structural and environmental characteristics. Analysis of results indicates that environmental characteristics generated from remote sensing technologies have strong influences on house values, and the addition of them improves house value modeling performance significantly. Moreover, the regression tree model proves as a better alternative to the OLS regression models in terms of predicting accuracy.In particular, based on the testing dataset, the mean average error (MAE) and relative error (RE) dropped from 0.202 and 0.434 for the OLS model to 0.134 and 0.280 for the regression tree model, while the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values increased from 0.903 to0.960. Further, as a nonparametric and local model, the regression tree method alleviates the problems with the OLS techniques and provides a means in delineating urban housing submarkets.},

This paper demonstrates that Building Coverage Ratio (BCR), Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and other building density indicators can be numerically and automatically derived from high-resolution airborne LiDAR data. An object-based method is proposed to process the LiDAR data for the building density information. The method consists of a sequence of numerical operations: generating the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM), extracting building objects, deriving object attributes, associating objects with the corresponding land lots, and computing building density indicators at land lot and urban district scales. The algorithms for these operations have been implemented as an ArcGIS extension module. The object-based method is applied to the processing of airborne LiDAR data over downtown Houston. Various attributes have been derived to quantify the building density, urban physical structure, and landscape morphological characteristics of the downtown area at three different spatial scales.},

  abstract = {The relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) associated with urban land-use type and land-use pattern is discussed in the City of Shanghai, China using data collected by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and aerial photographic remote sensing system. There is an apparent correlation between LST and NDVI from the visual interpretation of LST and NDVI contrasts. Mean LST and NDVI values associated with different land-use types are significantly different. Multiple comparisons of mean LST and NDVI values associated with pairings of each land-use type are also shown to be significantly different. The result of a regressive analysis shows an inverse correlation relationship between LST and NDVI within all land-use polygons, the same to each land-use type, but correlation coefficients associated with land-use types are different. An analysis on the relationship between LST, NDVI and Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) shows a positive correlation between LST and SHDI and a negative correlation between NDVI and SHDI. According to the above results, LST, SHDI and NDVI can be considered to be three basic indices to study the urban ecological environment and to contribute to further validation of the applicability of relatively low cost, moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery in evaluating environmental impacts of urban land function zoning, then to examine the impact of urban land-use on the urban environment in Shanghai City. This provides an effective tool in evaluating the environmental influences of zoning in urban ecosystems with remote sensing and geographical information systems.},

  abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78\% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.},
