# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hi!

I am Yifei Lin frome Guangzhou, China.

Now I am a Master student in UCL, studying Urban Spatial Science in Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. I majored in Urban Planning at Sun Yat-sen University at undergraduate level, which is a five-year subject.

In CASA, I would like to learn advanced spatial analysis and dynamic modelling methods, and study how to apply those technology into practical planning project or city policy.
