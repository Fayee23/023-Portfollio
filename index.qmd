# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio!

## About me

I am Yifei Lin frome Guangzhou, China.

Now I am a master's student in UCL, and major in Urban Spatial Science at Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA). I studied Urban Planning at Sun Yat-sen University at undergraduate level, which is a five-year subject.

In CASA, I would like to learn advanced spatial analysis and dynamic modelling methods, and study how to apply those technology into practical planning project or city policy, in order to construct a sustainable and smart city.

## About this portfolio

This is a "book" created from markdown and executable code. It is kind of my weekly learning diary of the module *Remote Sensing Cities and Environments*, including the summary of theoretical knowledge, their application, and my personal reflection.

Hopefully, it will be helpful for me in the future.

## Acknowledgement
