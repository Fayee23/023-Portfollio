# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hi!

I am Yifei Lin frome Guangzhou, China.

Now I am a master's student in UCL, and major in Urban Spatial Science at Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA). I studied Urban Planning at Sun Yat-sen University at undergraduate level, which is a five-year subject.

In CASA, I would like to learn advanced spatial analysis and dynamic modelling methods, and study how to apply those technology into practical planning project or city policy, in order to construct a sustainable and smart city.
