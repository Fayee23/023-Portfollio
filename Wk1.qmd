# Week 1: Introduction to Remote Sensing {.sec_wk2}

## Summary

### Sensor

a.  Passive (human eye, camera, satellite sensor)

-   Use available energy (reflected sun energy)

-   Emit nothing

-   Energy is in electromagnetic waves

b.  Active (Radar, X-ray, LiDAR)

-   Have an energy source for illumination

-   Actively emits electormagentic waves and then waits to receive (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) collects at longer wavelength that can pass through clouds)

### Electromagnetic radiation (EMR)

#### Terms

-   EMR: Waves of an electromagnetic field, travel through space and carry radiant energy

-   Electromagnetic wave: part of the EMR spectrum, EMR propagates as waves

-   Radiant flux: Energy per unit of time

#### Interacting with earth's surface

a.  Surface

-   Absorb energy

-   Transmit energy

b.  Atmospheric: *its particles scatter energy*

-   Rayleigh = particles are very small comparered to the wavelength ---- atmosphere

*The longer the wavelength is, the longer its light scatter reach (e.g. sky color)*

*The more it scattered, the deeper color it shows (e.g. shallow water vs deeper ocean)*

![wavelength](img01/wavelength1.png){#fig-wavelength}
:::

-   Mie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength

-   Non selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength

#### Polarization

-   Single: same polarization transmitted and received

-   Dual: One sent, different one received

*HH = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)*

![dual polarization](img01/polarization.png){#fig-polarization}

-   Quad polarization: system can transmit and receive four types

### Data

a.  Formats: raster

b.  Resolutions

-   Spatial resolution

-   Spectral resolution: how many surface acrossed visible spectrum.

*Ture color: what human see*

![Spectral signature](img01/spectral.png){#fig-spectral}

-   Radiometric resolution

*The higher the bit, the more information (light or reflectance)*

-   Temporal resolution

*The revisit time of the sensor (how often)*

c.  Jargon

-   Digital number(DN): raw data

-   Radiance: fixical data, also called Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance

-   Reflectance: measuring the property of a material, remove the effects of the light source in radiance

    -   Band 4: red (vegetation absorbs)

    -   Band 8: Near-infrared (NIR, that vegetation strongly reflects)

    -   high values of NIR and low values of red: dense vegetation

    -   low values of both red and NIR: wet bare soil.

## Application of satellite imagery

Satellite remote sensing imagery is the most common remote sensing data used in regional science research in urban settings [@patino2013]. And Landsat imagery is one of satellite remote sensing data with consistent medium resolution.

It collects data at each point on Earth each every 16 days (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of 30 by 30 m cells (spatial resolution).

Here are several research areas of its application.

### Quality of life index assessment

An evaluation of the quality of life of the urban population is important to support decision making and sustainable urban management and planning and to measure policy outcomes, which takes into account not only socio-economic information about people but also information on the geographical context and environmental conditions of urban areas [@craglia2004].

Various indices of quality of life, residential quality, attractiveness and a housing index have been estimated using remotely sensed data from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and SPOT sensors and complementary data from censuses and surveys on housing size and value, population density, income and education.

@lo1997 and @lo1997a used Landsat TM images combined with census data to assess the quality of life in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, using image processing techniques and information overlay in GIS, which provides a reproducible approach for future researchers. The environmental variables extracted from the image data were land-use/land-cover as a percentage of urban use, vegetation as a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and apparent surface temperature. The socio-economic variables extracted from the census data included population density, per capita income, median home value and percentage of college graduates. These data layers are integrated by principal component analysis and GIS overlay.

### Urban growth analysis

Urban growth trends can be detected easily using medium spatial resolution satellite images, such as SPOT and Landsat TM, taking advantage of the very different spectral properties of urban manmade structures versus rural spaces.

@madhavan2001 used Landsat TM images to measure and analyze the spatial growth of the Bangkok metropolitan area of Thailand.

### House value estimation

House prices have been estimated using data from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ and ASTER sensors as well as complementary data from censuses and surveys of house structural attributes, population density, income, and distance to a central business district.

@yu2006 used a Landsat ETM+ image for house value modeling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They integrated environmental characteristics derived from the remotely sensed image with house structural attributes to model house values using two different techniques: global ordinary least squares regression and a regression tree approach. The environmental characteristics derived from the image were the fractions of vegetation, impervious surface and soil, using the normalized spectral mixture analysis.

### Urban population estimation

An understanding of the population size and spatial distribution in urban areas is essential for social, economic and environmental applications.

@harvey2002 used a Landsat TM image and census data for Ballarat and Geelong, Australia, to allocate population estimates to each pixel of the image and overcome the problem of spatial aggregation of census data.


## Reflection

### Lessons

* Research on urban setting related to remote sensing usually need to use comprehensive types of data.

### Future research

It is still undetermined on the question of how to use the indicators and information that those analysis of remote sensing data provide [@li2007a].As with the relationships between society system and ecology system, local research and knowledge must be considered for the application of analysis results in policy making, urban planning and management.
