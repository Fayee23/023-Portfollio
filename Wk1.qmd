## Summary

### Sensor

a.  Passive (human eye, camera, satellite sensor)

-   Use available energy (reflected sun energy)

-   Emit nothing

-   Energy is in electromagnetic waves

b.  Active (Radar, X-ray, LiDAR)

-   Have an energy source for illumination

-   Actively emits electormagentic waves and then waits to receive (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) collects at longer wavelength that can pass through clouds)

### Electromagnetic radiation (EMR)

#### Terms

-   EMR: Waves of an electromagnetic field, travel through space and carry radiant energy

-   Electromagnetic wave: part of the EMR spectrum, EMR propagates as waves

-   Radiant flux: Energy per unit of time

#### Interacting with earth's surface

a.  Surface

-   Absorb energy

-   Transmit energy

b.  Atmospheric: *its particles scatter energy*

-   Rayleigh = particles are very small comparered to the wavelength ---- atmosphere

*The longer the wavelength is, the longer its light scatter reach (e.g. sky color)*

*The more it scattered, the deeper color it shows (e.g. shallow water vs deeper ocean)*

:::

-   Mie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength

-   Non selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength

#### Polarization

-   Single: same polarization transmitted and received

-   Dual: One sent, different one received

*HH = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)*

![dual polarization](img01/polarization.png){#fig-polarization}

-   Quad polarization: system can transmit and receive four types

### Data

a.  Formats: raster

b.  Resolutions

-   Spatial resolution

-   Spectral resolution: how many surface acrossed visible spectrum. 

*Ture color: what human see*

![Spectral signature](img01/spectral.png){#fig-spectral}

* Radiometric resolution

*The higher the bit, the more information (light or reflectance)*

* Temporal resolution

*The revisit time of the sensor (how often)*

c. Jargon

* Digital number(DN): raw data

* Radiance: fixical data, also called Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance

* Reflectance: measuring the property of a material, remove the effects of the light source in radiance

  * Band 4: red (vegetation absorbs) 
  
  * Band 8: Near-infrared (NIR, that vegetation strongly reflects)
  
  * high values of NIR and low values of red: dense vegetation 
  
  * low values of both red and NIR: wet bare soil.
