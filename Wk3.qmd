## Summary

### Corrections

a. Geometric correction

* Solution 1:  identify Ground Control Points (GPS) to match known points in the image and a reference dataset, take the coordinates and model them to give geometric transformation coefficients

  * GCP: ground control point

* Solution 2: RMSE


b. Atmospheric correction (remove the effect of atmosphere)

two sources of environmental attenuation: Atmospheric scattering, Topographic attenuation

* Relative

  * **Dark object subtraction (DOS)**: Searches each band for the darkest value then subtracts that from each pixel
  
  * **Psuedo-invariant Features (PIFs)**: Assume brightness pixels linearly related to a base image(e.g. the centre point of the pixel), adjust the image based on the regression result, apply it to the rest of the pixels
  
* Absolute 

Change digital brightness values into scaled surface reflectance. We can then compare these scaled surface reflectance values across the planet by **atmospheric radiative transfer models** 

* Empirical Line Correction

  * take measurements in situ using a field spectrometer, which require measurements at the same time as the satellite overpass

  * Then use these measurements in linear regression against the satellite data raw digital number
  
  * Path radiance: radiance reflected above the surface (e.g. scattering)

  * Atmospheric attenuation: absorption of EMR due to materials in atmosphere (e.g. water vapour)

c. Orthorectification correction (i.e  topographic correction)

* orthorectification = removing distortions (view staight down)

d. Radiometric Calibration

* Sensors capture image brightness and distributed as a Digital Number (or DN)

### Data joining and enhancement

a. Joining data sets

feather the images together and then creates a seamless mosaic or image(s)

* Within the overlap area an representative sample is taken

* A histogram is extracted from the base image

*It is then applied to image to using a histogram matching algorithm

b. Image enhancement

* Contrast Enhancement

* Edge enhancement

* Principal component Analysis: Transform multi-spectral data into uncorrelated and smaller dataset

* Texture analysis

* Image fusion
