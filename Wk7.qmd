# Week 7: Classification 2

## Summary

### Landcover classification

a.  Object based image analysis

-   consider shapes based on the similarity (homogeneity) or difference (heterogeneity) of the cells = **superpixels**

-   **Method** for Superpixel generation: SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering), based on the colour difference to the centre point (homogenity of colours)

-   advanced package: *SegOptim*

b.  Sub pixel analysis

-   Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA): determines the **proportion** or **abundance** of landcover per pixel

-   package: *MESMA (Multiple endmember spectral analysis)* from *RStoolbox*

-   Number of End members

    -   simplify the process and use the **V-I-S model** in urban areas: Vegetation-Impervious surface-Soil (V-I-S) fractions

    -   each cover type can only has one **end member**

### Accuracy assessment

a.  Terms

![Binary confusion matrix, Source: @barsi2018](img07/accuracymatrix.png){#fig-accuracy}

-   **PA**: Producer accuracy (recall or true positive rate or sensitivity)

    * defined as the fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP) compared to ground truth data (TP+**FN**)
    
    * $\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$

-   **UA**: User accuracy (consumer's accuracy or precision or positive predictive value)

    * defined as the fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP) relative to all others classified as a particular land cover(TP+**FP**)
    
    * $\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$

-   **OA**: the (overall) accuracy

    * represents the combined fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP +TN) across all land cover types (TP+FP+FN+TN)
    
    * $\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+FN+TN}$

* Where model is **correct**

    * True positive = model predicts positive class correctly
    
    * True negative = model predicts negative class correctly
    
* Where model is **incorrect**

    * False positive = model predicts positive, but it is negative

    * False negative = model predicts negative, but it is positive
    
* Errors of omission: Landcover omitted from correct class (100 - PA)

* Errors of commission: Classified sites for incorrect classifications (100 - UA)

* Kappa coefficient
    
    * Designed to express the accuracy of an image compared to the results by chance
    
    * Ranges from 0 to 1
