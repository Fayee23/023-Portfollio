    "section": "1.2 Application of satellite imagery",
    "text": "1.2 Application of satellite imagery\nSatellite remote sensing imagery is the most common remote sensing data used in regional science research in urban settings (Patino and Duque 2013). And Landsat imagery is one of satellite remote sensing data with consistent medium resolution.\nIt collects data at each point on Earth each every 16 days (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of 30 by 30 m cells (spatial resolution).\nHere are several research areas of its application.\n\n1.2.1 Quality of life index assessment\nAn evaluation of the quality of life of the urban population is important to support decision making and sustainable urban management and planning and to measure policy outcomes, which takes into account not only socio-economic information about people but also information on the geographical context and environmental conditions of urban areas (Craglia et al. 2004).\nVarious indices of quality of life, residential quality, attractiveness and a housing index have been estimated using remotely sensed data from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and SPOT sensors and complementary data from censuses and surveys on housing size and value, population density, income and education.\nLo (1997) and Lo and Faber (1997) used Landsat TM images combined with census data to assess the quality of life in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, using image processing techniques and information overlay in GIS, which provides a reproducible approach for future researchers. The environmental variables extracted from the image data were land-use/land-cover as a percentage of urban use, vegetation as a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and apparent surface temperature. The socio-economic variables extracted from the census data included population density, per capita income, median home value and percentage of college graduates. These data layers are integrated by principal component analysis and GIS overlay.\n\n\n1.2.2 Urban growth analysis\nUrban growth trends can be detected easily using medium spatial resolution satellite images, such as SPOT and Landsat TM, taking advantage of the very different spectral properties of urban manmade structures versus rural spaces.\nMadhavan et al. (2001) used Landsat TM images to measure and analyze the spatial growth of the Bangkok metropolitan area of Thailand.\n\n\n1.2.3 House value estimation\nHouse prices have been estimated using data from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ and ASTER sensors as well as complementary data from censuses and surveys of house structural attributes, population density, income, and distance to a central business district.\nYu and Wu (2006) used a Landsat ETM+ image for house value modeling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They integrated environmental characteristics derived from the remotely sensed image with house structural attributes to model house values using two different techniques: global ordinary least squares regression and a regression tree approach. The environmental characteristics derived from the image were the fractions of vegetation, impervious surface and soil, using the normalized spectral mixture analysis.\n\n\n1.2.4 Urban population estimation\nAn understanding of the population size and spatial distribution in urban areas is essential for social, economic and environmental applications.\nHarvey (2002) used a Landsat TM image and census data for Ballarat and Geelong, Australia, to allocate population estimates to each pixel of the image and overcome the problem of spatial aggregation of census data."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\n\n1.3.1 The importance of remote sensing\n\nEnvironmental monitoring: Remote sensing can be used to monitor the environment and assess changes in land use, vegetation cover, water resources, and atmospheric conditions. This information is important for managing natural resources, predicting natural disasters, and understanding the impacts of climate change.\nMapping and planning: Remote sensing data can be used to create accurate maps and support planning and development activities. For example, remote sensing can help identify suitable sites for new infrastructure or monitor urban growth.\nAgriculture: Remote sensing can help farmers optimize crop management by providing information about soil moisture, crop health, and yield potential. This information can help reduce water and fertilizer use and increase crop productivity.\nDisaster management: Remote sensing can be used to support disaster management by providing information about the extent and severity of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and wildfires. This information can help emergency responders prioritize their efforts and allocate resources effectively.\nNational security: Remote sensing can be used for intelligence gathering and monitoring of military activities. Satellites equipped with high-resolution cameras and other sensors can detect and track movement of troops, weapons, and other military equipment.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Remote sensing for planning\n\nRemote sensing can make the field research easier, in terms of learning the land use conditions and building information, which is an important part before doing a planning project.\nRemote sensing can also lead to a reasonable and effective planning with urban population estimation, life quality assessment and house value estimation.\nResearch on urban setting related to remote sensing usually need to use comprehensive types of data, such as census data and satellite imagery.\nThere is a combine usage of statistics analysis approach and spatial analysis approach in related research, such as principal component analysis, global ordinary least squares regression and GIS overlay.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Future research\nIt is still undetermined on the question of how to use the indicators and information that those analysis of remote sensing data provide (Li and Weng 2007).As with the relationships between society system and ecology system, local research and knowledge must be considered for the application of analysis results in policy making, urban planning and management.\n\n\n\n\nCraglia, Massimo, Lila Leontidou, Giampaolo Nuvolati, and Jürgen Schweikart. 2004. “Towards the Development of Quality of Life Indicators in the ‘Digital’ City.” Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 31 (1): 51–64. https://doi.org/10.1068/b12918.\n\n\nHarvey, Jack T. 2002. “Population Estimation Models Based on Individual TM Pixels.” PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING.\n\n\nLi, G., and Q.

    "text": "3.2 Application\nBecause the solar radiation on the sun-surface-sensor path in the visible and NIR spectral regions is subject to absorption and scattering by atmospheric gases and aerosols, the hyperspectral imaging data contains atmospheric effects.\nIn order to use hyperspectral imaging data for quantitative remote sensing of land surfaces and ocean color, the atmospheric effects must be removed.\nGao et al. (2000) developed an atmospheric correction algorithm for hyperspectral remote sensing of ocean color with the near-future Coastal Ocean Imaging Spectrometer. The algorithm uses lookup tables generated with a vector radiative transfer code. Aerosol parameters are determined by a spectrum-matching technique that uses channels located at wavelengths longer than 0.86 um. The aerosol information is extracted back to the visible based on aerosol models during the retrieval of water-leaving radiances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Result in Chesapeake Bay, Source: Gao et al.

(2000)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the sample result of Chesapeake Bay, the overall shapes of the reflectance spectra above 0.45 um are quite consistent with those measured from other field measurements. Below 0.45 um, the reflectances fall off too rapidly with decreasing wavelengths and even become negative for wavelengths less than 0.41 um. It is likely due to radiometric calibration of the AVIRIS instrument, which reports too-small radiances in the blue spectral region.\nIn the sample result of Florida Keys, for the deepest water reflectance spectrum (marked I), the reflectance peak is centered near 0.50 um. For the shallowest water (marked IV), the reflectance peak is centered approximately at 0.57 um. The shapes of the Fig.9(c) reflectance spectra above 0.45 mm are consistent with those of field-measured reflectance spectra over similar clear waters with a sand bottom in Lake Tahoe.\nWithout field-measured reflectance spectra corresponding to the spectra in those sample result, direct comparisons between the retrieved reflectances and field-measured reflectances can hardly be conducted."

These measurements can be affected by various factors such as atmospheric conditions, sensor calibration, and surface reflectance properties. Thus, it is essential to remove or minimize these effects and improve the accuracy of the data.\nThe correction of remote sensing data is crucial for many applications, such as land use and land cover mapping, agriculture monitoring, and natural resources management. Accurate and reliable remote sensing data are essential for making informed decisions and policies based on scientific evidence.\nBesides, data correction and enhancement are quite practical in real project, because we should know to what extent the data is being manipulated and how it is processed although we don’t need to do the data correction by ourselves. Also, we may need to join the data sets and merge the imagery to show the research area or planning site.\n\n\n\n\n\nGao, Bo-Cai, Marcos J. Montes, Ziauddin Ahmad, and Curtiss O.

One of the strategies for SDGs is as follow.\n\nBy 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations\n\nHere, I focus on the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) which can be able to solve the water-related disasters mentioned above. To achieve efficient storm water management, Sydney has a strategy in the “Smart City Strategic Framework” (2020).\n\nExplore options for developing artificial intelligence capabilities to drive efficient resource use, and advance the circular economy. Machine learning capabilities can analyse data collected from sensor networks to monitor quality of urban conditions and automate decisions.

With the identification of potential flooding area with different level, differential management can be constructed at the most essential places without the waste of cost and resource. If the infrastructure is aging or creaking, it can be modifies and responded in time with real-time monitoring of the urban condition.

RF classifier is effective because of its insensitivity to noise or over classifying. RF classifier was employed with 50 classification trees based on a sensitivity test of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 trees, because little performance improved after 50 trees to this study (Liang et al. 2020).\nGEE is quite wonderful because there are tons of datasets cover the world and over the years, which is convenient for research of space-time evolution. Besides, user can design specific functions for their own studies and then repeat the analysis process easily.\nOne of the main advantages of Google Earth Engine is its ability to process large amounts of satellite data quickly and efficiently. This makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, disaster response, and land use planning.\nFrom the perspective of GEE technology, the augmentation of GEE APIs and functions can be implemented with either JavaScript or Python. Python tools, such as image analysis and statistical modeling tools, can be easily to integrate with APIs of GEE to strength our functions. In addition, Pythons provides a more flexible environment to develop user-defined functions with more intuitive user interface in comparison with GEE’s online Code Editor. Therefore, the integration of Python and GEE can realize more comprehensive and sophisticated sustainability algorithms, to provide better evaluation tools and to support flexible user interactions with the ESV estimation and sustainability modeling algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiang, Jianyuan, Yichun Xie, Zongyao Sha, and Alicia Zhou. 2020. “Modeling Urban Growth Sustainability in the Cloud by Augmenting Google Earth Engine (GEE).” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 84 (November): 101542. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101542."

Recognizing the complexity in differentiating slum and formal areas in Indonesia, the study used a combination of spectral, contextual, and morphological features. In addition, sequential feature selection (SFS) combined with the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) was used to select significant features for classifying slums.\n\n6.2.1 Policy background\nThe Indonesian government conducted a survey-based slum mapping (SBSM) program to reach the national target of “cities without slums” by 2019.\nTo upgrade slum areas, the Indonesian government requires a consistent, detailed, correct, and timely method that meets the requirements specified in planning documents. However, inconsistencies and temporal delays are shortcomings of the SBSM undertaken by the Indonesian government, due to the dependency on the surveyor’s experiences and the complexity of the slum indicators set.\nBy relying on such inconsistent maps, it will be difficult to monitor the national slum upgrading program’s progress.\nRemote sensing imagery combined with machine learning algorithms could support the reduction of these inconsistencies.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Slum upgrading program combined with SBSM, Source: Leonita et al.

Deilami and Kamruzzaman (2017) utilities Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2004, and 2013 to: first, estimate and validate a Geographically Weighted Regression model in order to identify statistically significant factors influencing the UHI intensities in Brisbane; and second, predict the UHI intensities of the five policy scenarios. Two factors were identified to have significant influence on the UHI intensities in Brisbane: population density, and porosity.\n\n8.2.1 Policy background\nIt is evident that sprawl development increases the UHI effect (Zhao et al. 2016) and high-density urban development can amplify the UHI intensities (Elsayed 2012). Research has also identified that the UHI intensities vary between low-populated sprawl and highpopulated sprawl (Lemonsu et al. 2015).\nHigh-density is an important characteristic of smart growth policies. This implies that smart growth policies could also lead to increasing UHI effect.\n\n\n8.2.2 Data and methodology\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Source: Deilami and Kamruzzaman (2017)\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Results\n\nUrban growth pattern\n\nUrban growth patterned followed the policy recommendation as outlined in the 2005 version of the South East Queensland Regional Plan that Brisbane needs a policy shift from horizontal expansion of cities to vertical expansion to accommodate population growth in a sustainable manner. Note that Brisbane population grew by 1.4% and 1.9% between 1991 and 2004, and between 2004 and 2013 respectively. Despite the population growth continued, the rate of urban expansion dropped significantly during the latter period.\n * Urban Heat Island pattern\nOn average, the urban areas in Brisbane experienced 1.31 ◦C, 2.98 ◦C, 3.75 ◦C higher temperature compared to their rural surrounding in 1991, 2004, and 2013 respectively. Spatially, the suburbs with UHI effect vary between the periods.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: UHI pattern, Source: Deilami and Kamruzzaman (2017)\n\n\nResults show that compared to the 2004 and 2013 levels, Brisbane will experience a middle levels of UHI effect in 2023, irrespective of the policy scenarios.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: UHI prediction\n\n\nOn average, the infill development scenario, as a smart growth policy, has a marginally better potential to mitigate the UHI effect in Brisbane in 2023 compared to the sprawl development scenario conditional on the definition applied in this research. The UHI effect would be more equitably balanced spatially under the sprawl development scenario.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: UHI in different senarioes"

The effects of urbanization, such as the construction of buildings and transportation infrastructure, can significantly impact local temperatures and exacerbate the urban heat island effect, which can lead to negative health outcomes for residents and increase energy demands for cooling.\nAs such, urban policy related to temperature should prioritize the development of green infrastructure, such as green roofs and walls, urban forests, and parks, which can help to reduce surface temperatures, increase shading, and provide cooling effects through evapotranspiration. Additionally, policies that promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources can help to reduce the overall heat load of a city and decrease the use of energy-intensive cooling systems.\nFurthermore, it is important for urban policy related to temperature to address equity and social justice concerns, as vulnerable populations are often most affected by extreme heat. Policies that prioritize the provision of cooling centers and other cooling options in low-income and marginalized communities can help to mitigate the negative impacts of heat and promote greater health equity."

    "text": "6.3 Reflection\nEach method of classification has its own advantage and disadvantage. The choice of classification method depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data being analyzed. Some methods may be more accurate than others, depending on the complexity of the landscape and the spectral variability of the different land cover or land use classes.\nIn the study above (Leonita et al. 2018), both SVM and RF classification results show misclassification, particularly for small formal structures. This is due to similar morphological characteristics and roof material of both categories, thus with an image, we can only capture morphological slums(Wurm and Taubenböck 2018; Taubenböck, Kraff, and Wurm 2018). Furthermore, the uncertainty of slum boundaries plays a role that slums and nonslums have fuzzy boundaries.\nTherefore, I think it is necessary to combine with the extraction of building information (see application section in week 2) after a general classification. With the data of building density, building sizes and height, and average building distance, the slum boundary can be confirm at block level and even individual buildings level. This will improve the accuracy of slums detection.\nInterestingly, I find Taubenböck and Kraff (2014) has carried out a study identifying characteristic physical features of the built environment that allows defining slum areas. Using highresolution optical satellite data, parameters such as building density, building heights, and sizes are used to differentiate between slums and formal settlements.\nGoing back to the lecture content, classification is complicated but powerful. It is an important method used in remote sensing for analyzing and categorizing land cover and land use patterns, providing valuable information for environmental monitoring, land use planning, and natural resource management. Also, it reduces a large amount of manual work.\n\n\n\n\nLeonita, Gina, Monika Kuffer, Richard Sliuzas, and Claudio Persello. 2018. “Machine Learning-Based Slum Mapping in Support of Slum Upgrading Programs: The Case of Bandung City, Indonesia.” Remote Sensing 10 (10): 1522. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10101522.\n\n\nTaubenböck, H., and N.

However, limited funding can be a major barrier to implementing these policies at the scale necessary to effectively mitigate the UHI effect.\nChallenges in measuring and evaluating policy effectiveness: It can be difficult to measure the effectiveness of UHI mitigation policies, as their impacts can vary depending on factors such as climate, land use, and building density. Additionally, there is a need for standardized metrics and evaluation frameworks to assess the effectiveness of different policies and ensure that they are achieving their intended outcomes.\nEquity considerations: UHI mitigation policies must also consider equity, as vulnerable populations such as low-income communities and communities of color are often most affected by the UHI effect. Policies that prioritize these communities, such as the provision of cooling centers and the creation of green spaces in urban areas, can help to promote greater equity in UHI mitigation efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeilami, Kaveh, and Md Kamruzzaman. 2017. “Modelling the Urban Heat Island Effect of Smart Growth Policy Scenarios in Brisbane.” Land Use Policy 64 (May): 38–55. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.02.027.\n\n\nElsayed, Ilham SM. 2012. “Effects of Population Density and Land Management on the Intensity of Urban Heat Islands: A Case Study on the City of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.” Application of Geographic Information Systems, 267–83.\n\n\nLemonsu, A., V.
