    "section": "1.2 Application of satellite imagery",
    "text": "1.2 Application of satellite imagery\nSatellite remote sensing imagery is the most common remote sensing data used in regional science research in urban settings (Patino and Duque 2013). And Landsat imagery is one of satellite remote sensing data with consistent medium resolution.\nIt collects data at each point on Earth each every 16 days (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of 30 by 30 m cells (spatial resolution).\nHere are several research areas of its application.\n\n1.2.1 Quality of life index assessment\nAn evaluation of the quality of life of the urban population is important to support decision making and sustainable urban management and planning and to measure policy outcomes, which takes into account not only socio-economic information about people but also information on the geographical context and environmental conditions of urban areas (Craglia et al. 2004).\nVarious indices of quality of life, residential quality, attractiveness and a housing index have been estimated using remotely sensed data from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and SPOT sensors and complementary data from censuses and surveys on housing size and value, population density, income and education.\nLo (1997) and Lo and Faber (1997) used Landsat TM images combined with census data to assess the quality of life in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, using image processing techniques and information overlay in GIS, which provides a reproducible approach for future researchers. The environmental variables extracted from the image data were land-use/land-cover as a percentage of urban use, vegetation as a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and apparent surface temperature. The socio-economic variables extracted from the census data included population density, per capita income, median home value and percentage of college graduates. These data layers are integrated by principal component analysis and GIS overlay.\n\n\n1.2.2 Urban growth analysis\nUrban growth trends can be detected easily using medium spatial resolution satellite images, such as SPOT and Landsat TM, taking advantage of the very different spectral properties of urban manmade structures versus rural spaces.\nMadhavan et al. (2001) used Landsat TM images to measure and analyze the spatial growth of the Bangkok metropolitan area of Thailand.\n\n\n1.2.3 House value estimation\nHouse prices have been estimated using data from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ and ASTER sensors as well as complementary data from censuses and surveys of house structural attributes, population density, income, and distance to a central business district.\nYu and Wu (2006) used a Landsat ETM+ image for house value modeling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They integrated environmental characteristics derived from the remotely sensed image with house structural attributes to model house values using two different techniques: global ordinary least squares regression and a regression tree approach. The environmental characteristics derived from the image were the fractions of vegetation, impervious surface and soil, using the normalized spectral mixture analysis.\n\n\n1.2.4 Urban population estimation\nAn understanding of the population size and spatial distribution in urban areas is essential for social, economic and environmental applications.\nHarvey (2002) used a Landsat TM image and census data for Ballarat and Geelong, Australia, to allocate population estimates to each pixel of the image and overcome the problem of spatial aggregation of census data."

    "text": "3.2 Application\nBecause the solar radiation on the sun-surface-sensor path in the visible and NIR spectral regions is subject to absorption and scattering by atmospheric gases and aerosols, the hyperspectral imaging data contains atmospheric effects.\nIn order to use hyperspectral imaging data for quantitative remote sensing of land surfaces and ocean color, the atmospheric effects must be removed.\nGao et al. (2000) developed an atmospheric correction algorithm for hyperspectral remote sensing of ocean color with the near-future Coastal Ocean Imaging Spectrometer. The algorithm uses lookup tables generated with a vector radiative transfer code. Aerosol parameters are determined by a spectrum-matching technique that uses channels located at wavelengths longer than 0.86 um. The aerosol information is extracted back to the visible based on aerosol models during the retrieval of water-leaving radiances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Result in Chesapeake Bay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Result in Florida Keys\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Gao et al. (2000)\nIn the sample result of Chesapeake Bay, the overall shapes of the reflectance spectra above 0.45 um are quite consistent with those measured from other field measurements. Below 0.45 um, the reflectances fall off too rapidly with decreasing wavelengths and even become negative for wavelengths less than 0.41 um. It is likely due to radiometric calibration of the AVIRIS instrument, which reports too-small radiances in the blue spectral region.\nIn the sample result of Florida Keys, for the deepest water reflectance spectrum (marked I), the reflectance peak is centered near 0.50 um. For the shallowest water (marked IV), the reflectance peak is centered approximately at 0.57 um. The shapes of the Fig.9(c) reflectance spectra above 0.45 mm are consistent with those of field-measured reflectance spectra over similar clear waters with a sand bottom in Lake Tahoe.\nWithout field-measured reflectance spectra corresponding to the spectra in those sample result, direct comparisons between the retrieved reflectances and field-measured reflectances can hardly be conducted."

One of the strategies for SDGs is as follow.\n\nBy 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations\n\nHere, I focus on the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) which can be able to solve the water-related disasters mentioned above. To achieve efficient storm water management, Sydney has a strategy in the “Smart City Strategic Framework” (2020).\n\nExplore options for developing artificial intelligence capabilities to drive efficient resource use, and advance the circular economy. Machine learning capabilities can analyse data collected from sensor networks to monitor quality of urban conditions and automate decisions. For example, a smart stormwater system could determine cleaning and maintenance schedules and identify flooding risks, or smart irrigation can help us manage water use to green the city.\n\nThis strategy not only solve the challenge of storm water management effectively, but also reduce the unnecessary cost and reuse water resource. With the identification of potential flooding area with different level, differential management can be constructed at the most essential places without the waste of cost and resource. If the infrastructure is aging or creaking, it can be modifies and responded in time with real-time monitoring of the urban condition. Green Infrastructure can also be applied together to reuse water resource and improve the quality of landscape and environment."
