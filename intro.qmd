# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

It is kind of my learning diary of the module *Remote Sensing Cities and Environments*, including the summary of theoretical knowledge, their application, and my reflection.

Hopefully, it will be helpful for me in the future.
