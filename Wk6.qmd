# Week 6: Classification

## Summary

### Classified data in Action

extract land cover from earth observation data

* Urban expansion

* Air pollution and LULC

* Urban green spaces

* Monitoring forests + illegal logging
 tree
* Forest fires

### Classify remote sense data

a. Expert systems

* a system that uses human knowledge to solve problems that normally require human intelligence

* example: machine learning

b. Classification and regression trees (CART)

* classification trees

* regression trees: subset the data into smaller chunks if linear regression doesn't fit

    * each leaf is a regression model, if we have a leaf with just one person or one pixel value it will be **over fitting**

    * To prevent over fitting we can set a minimum number of observations before splitting the data again.
  
    * Or limit how trees grow by pruning the weakest link with tree score: calculate the sum of the squared residuals (SSR) before and after removing a leaf
  
> Tree score = SSR + tree penalty (alpha) * T (number of leaves)
  
c. Random forests: many classification decision trees

Make decision tree from random number of variables (never all of them), and then repeat

* For each tree about 70% of the training data is used in the bootstrap, then test the rest data (OOB data), repeat for all OOB samples and the one getting most votes wins

* Often the number of variables per tree is calculated from square root of variables in the original data.

d. Image classification

* Turn every pixel in the image into one of a pre-defined categorical classification

* Category:

* can add everything such as texture

e. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
