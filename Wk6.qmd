# Week 6: Classification

## Summary

### Classified data in Action

extract land cover from earth observation data

* Urban expansion

* Air pollution and LULC

* Urban green spaces

* Monitoring forests + illegal logging
 tree
* Forest fires

### Classify remote sense data

a. Expert systems

b. Classification and regression trees (CART)

* classification trees

* regression trees: subset the data into smaller chunks if linear regression doesn't fit

  * each leaf is a regression model, if we have a leaf with just one person or one pixel value it will be over fitting
  
  * To prevent over fitting we can set a minimum number of observations before splitting the data again.
  
  * Or limit how trees grow by pruning the weakest link with tree score: calculate the sum of the squared residuals (SSR) before and after removing a leaf
  
> Tree score = SSR + tree penalty (alpha) * T (number of leaves)
  
c. Random forests: many classification decision trees

Make decision tree from random number of variables (never all of them), and then repeat

* For each tree about 70% of the training data is used in the bootstrap, then test the rest data (OOB data), repeat for all OOB samples and the one getting most votes wins

d. Image classification

can add everything such as texture
