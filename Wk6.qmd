# Week 6: Classification {.sec_wk6}

## Summary

### Classified data in Action

extract land cover from earth observation data

* Urban expansion

* Air pollution and LULC

* Urban green spaces

* Monitoring forests + illegal logging
 tree
* Forest fires

### Classify remote sense data

a. Expert systems

* a system that uses human knowledge to solve problems that normally require human intelligence

* example: machine learning

b. Classification and regression trees (CART)

* classification trees

* regression trees: subset the data into smaller chunks if linear regression doesn't fit

    * each leaf is a regression model, if we have a leaf with just one person or one pixel value it will be **over fitting**

    * To prevent over fitting we can set a minimum number of observations before splitting the data again.
  
    * Or limit how trees grow by pruning the weakest link with tree score: calculate the sum of the squared residuals (SSR) before and after removing a leaf
  
> Tree score = SSR + tree penalty (alpha) * T (number of leaves)
  
c. Random forests: many classification decision trees

Make decision tree from random number of variables (never all of them), and then repeat

* For each tree about 70% of the training data is used in the bootstrap, then test the rest data (OOB data), repeat for all OOB samples and the one getting most votes wins

* Often the number of variables per tree is calculated from square root of variables in the original data.

d. Image classification

* Turn every pixel in the image into one of a pre-defined categorical classification

* Category:

![mindmap of image classification](img06/mindmap.png)

* can add everything such as texture

e. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

a linear binary classifier, like logistic regression, classify training data by **maximum margin classifier**.

* Underlying theory: structural risk minimisation, minimise error on unseen data with no assumptions on the distribution

## Application

@leonita2018 evaluated the performance of two machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), for slum mapping in support of the slum mapping campaign in Bandung, Indonesia. Recognizing the complexity in differentiating slum and formal areas in Indonesia, the study used a combination of spectral, contextual, and morphological features. In addition, sequential feature selection (SFS) combined with the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) was used to select significant features for classifying slums.

### Policy background

The Indonesian government conducted a survey-based slum mapping (SBSM) program to reach the national target of “cities without slums” by 2019.

To upgrade slum areas, the Indonesian government requires a consistent, detailed, correct, and timely method that meets the requirements specified in planning documents. However, inconsistencies and temporal delays are shortcomings of the SBSM undertaken by the Indonesian government, due to the dependency on the surveyor’s experiences and the complexity of the slum indicators set.

By relying on such inconsistent maps, it will be difficult to monitor the national slum upgrading program’s progress.

Remote sensing imagery combined with machine learning algorithms could support the reduction of these inconsistencies.
